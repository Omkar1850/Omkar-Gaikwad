        <h2>What is an Incoterm?</h2>
        <p>
          An <strong>Incoterm</strong> (short for International Commercial Term) is one of a set of standardized trade terms published by the
          <strong>International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          These terms define the responsibilities of buyers and sellers in international trade — covering delivery, transportation costs, insurance, and when risk transfers.
        </p>

        <h2>Why are Incoterms Important?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Clarity and Standardization:</strong>Incoterms provide a common set of rules that are widely recognized and understood around the world. This ensures that both parties in a transaction—regardless of their country or legal system—have a clear understanding of their responsibilities, such as who is responsible for shipping, insurance, customs duties, and other costs.</li>
          <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Incoterms clearly define the point at which the risk of loss or damage to the goods transfers from the seller to the buyer. This is crucial in determining who bears responsibility for the goods at different stages of the shipping process.</li>
          <li><strong>Cost Distribution:</strong>  Incoterms allocate costs between the buyer and seller. This can include transportation, insurance, duties, and unloading costs. Knowing these responsibilities helps prevent disputes over who should pay for what during the shipment process.</li>
          <li><strong>Legal Protection:</strong> By incorporating Incoterms into contracts, parties can avoid misunderstandings and have a clearer path for resolving disputes. Since Incoterms are legally recognized in many countries, they can be used in court or arbitration if a conflict arises.</li>
          <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Incoterms help streamline the logistics process by ensuring both parties know their obligations from the outset. This reduces delays, confusion, and inefficiencies that might otherwise occur in international shipments</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Incoterms are crucial because they establish a clear, standardized framework for the distribution of responsibilities and risks in international trade, making transactions smoother, more efficient, and less prone to disputes.

              The seller delivers the goods when they are placed at the buyer’s disposal, on the arriving means of transport, ready for unloading at the named destination.
            </p>
            <p class="example">
              Example: The seller delivers the goods when they arrive in Tokyo and are made available for unloading.
